    <p>My name is Keith Owens Jr. I am a high school web designer, who currently attends Warren Central High school. I was first interested in technology when I was 8 and decided that I wanted a career with technology when I turned 12. I like to bowl competitively for my school and just in general. I am also apart of my High school's robotics team as a programmer and a driver. Currently I am a Catapult in Nextech's summer internship program.
